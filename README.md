# Overview

This is a synth that generates waveforms by adding sines together.

It can be inefficient to generate waveforms this way for low frequencies, but it's fun and easy to understand. It's also quite easy to avoid aliasing.

Ring modulation can be applied on each of the sines to change the sound's texture, and most parameters are controllable at a sample-rate level via ADSR envelopes and LFOs in many different combinations.

A shaped "amplitude boost" that emulates a sharp filter cutoff can also be swept along the waveform.

# Generation equation

Three classic synth waveforms can be generated by summing sines according to the following equations:

```
saw
j=1 -1**j * 1/j * sin(2*pi*j*f*t)

square
j=1 1/(2*j-1) * sin(2*pi*(2*j-1)*f*t)

tri
j=0 -1**j * (2*j+1) * sin(2*pi*j*f*t)
```

This synth uses a unified equation that can cover all the above cases, as follows:

	j=start powbase**(j*expmul) * (scalemul*j+scaleoff)**scaleexp * sin(2*pi*(scalemul*j+scaleoff)*f*t)
	
By configuring the parameters correctly, this equation can generate each of the above waveforms, and maybe some other interesting ones besides.
